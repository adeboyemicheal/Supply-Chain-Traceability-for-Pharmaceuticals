# Supply Chain Traceability for Pharmaceuticals

## Overview
This project implements a blockchain-based solution for end-to-end pharmaceutical supply chain traceability. The system ensures medication integrity from manufacturing to patient, combats counterfeit drugs, enables efficient recalls, and supports regulatory compliance across the pharmaceutical ecosystem.

## Core Components

### Manufacturer Verification Contract
Validates legitimate drug producers through certification records, manufacturing licenses, and regulatory approvals. Creates a trusted network of verified pharmaceutical manufacturers with cryptographically secured identities and compliance histories.

### Batch Tracking Contract
Monitors medications through the distribution process by recording critical events including production, quality testing, packaging, wholesaler transfers, and pharmacy delivery. Maintains immutable batch records with lot numbers, expiration dates, and chain-of-custody documentation.

### Temperature Monitoring Contract
Ensures proper storage conditions are maintained throughout transportation and warehousing by integrating with IoT sensors. Records continuous temperature data for cold chain medications and generates immutable alerts when conditions deviate from required parameters.

### Authentication Contract
Allows verification of medication legitimacy at the point of dispensing through serialization and cryptographic proof. Enables pharmacists and patients to confirm product authenticity, check for recalls, and verify handling compliance before administration.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Configure your blockchain environment
4. Deploy the contracts
5. Integrate with pharmaceutical systems and IoT devices

## Architecture
The solution uses interoperable smart contracts that maintain data integrity throughout the pharmaceutical supply chain. Sensitive information is cryptographically protected while enabling verification by authorized parties.

## Security Considerations
- Role-based access controls for supply chain participants
- Cryptographic validation of product identifiers
- Secure handling of proprietary formulation data
- Emergency protocols for rapid recall situations

## Compliance
This solution is designed to meet pharmaceutical regulations including:
- FDA Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA)
- EU Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD)
- GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) requirements
- WHO guidelines for pharmaceutical traceability

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from pharmaceutical professionals, supply chain specialists, and blockchain developers. Please see our contribution guidelines for more information.
